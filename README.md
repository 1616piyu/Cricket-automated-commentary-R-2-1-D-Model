# Cricket-automated-commentary-R(2+1)D-Model

 Overview

The Real-Time Cricket Commentary System is an AI-based application that analyzes live or recorded cricket match videos and generates meaningful commentary by understanding player actions and match events using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

 Problem Statement

Manual cricket commentary is limited by human availability and scalability. There is a need for an automated system that can analyze live video feeds, recognize cricket actions, and assist in generating real-time commentary using AI.

 Objectives

Analyze cricket match videos in real time

Recognize player actions accurately

Support automated or semi-automated commentary generation

Build a scalable video-to-commentary pipeline

 My Contribution

Generated and curated cricket action video datasets for model training

Implemented and trained the R(2+1)D deep learning model for action recognition

Assisted in integrating the action recognition module into the video-to-commentary pipeline

Supported model optimization and real-time inference workflow

 System Workflow

Input cricket video (live or recorded)

Frame extraction and preprocessing

Player and ball detection using YOLOv8

Action recognition using R(2+1)D model
